	* Complete redesign of the module, previously known as MIGBeadArray now
	  renamed to MicroarrayGEX, preserves the philosophy of dynamically
 	  generated R code and publishing material.
 	  
	* Wiki and other markup outputs were scraped
	
	* Implementation of Sweave to generate a single PDF document as output
	  for the analysis (along with the toptables and QC plots which suffer
	  no changes at all).

	* Move from Getopt::Std to Getopt::Long
	
	* Multiple bug fixes and clean ups for the code, including new sub's
	  for better manipulation of the dynamically generated outputs.
